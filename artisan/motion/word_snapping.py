"""Snap proposed clip boundaries onto real word boundaries.

Vendored from openshorts (MIT, github.com/mutonby/openshorts,
clip_selection.py::snap_clip_to_words). Unchanged logic; stdlib only.

LLMs are bad at millisecond arithmetic; the word-level timestamps are ground
truth, so cuts land in pauses instead of mid-word.
