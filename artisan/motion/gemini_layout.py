"""Gemini prompts + response schemas for the layout modules.

Vendored from openshorts gemini_worker.py (MIT) on 2026-08-25 — only the
layout-related pieces: LAYOUT_CHOICE_PROMPT/LayoutChoice feed
``layout_picker.pick()``; WIDE_CONTENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE/WideContentResponse
feed ``screencast_layout.detect_content_ranges()``; raise_if_blocked is
shared by both.

Do not reword the prompts casually: both were measured against a hand-checked
48-clip corpus and the wins come from their exact instructions — see the
notes above each one upstream and mirrored here.

pydantic is imported at module top because google-genai's structured output
consumes these models directly. Callers import THIS module inside their
own try blocks, so a missing pydantic degrades exactly like any other
Gemini failure.

LAYOUT_CHOICE_PROMPT = """
These frames are sampled at regular intervals from a single landscape video.
You are choosing how to re-frame that video into a vertical 9:16 clip.

Pick ONE layout:

- "none": crop to the speaker and fill the frame. This is the RIGHT answer for
  ordinary talking heads, interviews shot in close-up, b-roll, sport, action,
  music, and any footage whose meaning survives a centre crop. Corner logos,
  score bugs, subscriber counters, lower-thirds and burned-in subtitles do NOT
  change this: they are decoration, and losing them costs nothing.
- "screencast": keep the screen. ONLY when the video is built around a screen
  recording, slides, a spreadsheet, a chart or a map that the viewer must read
  to follow it. If you cannot read words or numbers off the screen that matter
  to the point being made, it is not this.
  (A "camera_inset" option was added here and removed on 31-jul-2026. Whether a
  webcam is composited into a corner of that screen is not something the model
  can see: on the five clips that have one it answered "screencast" every time,
  in both runs, while overall accuracy fell from 92% to 83-85%. camera_inset.py
  finds the same five geometrically with no false positives, so that question is
  answered downstream instead of being asked here.)
- "split": stack two people. ONLY when two people are visible IN THE SAME SHOT
  at the same time in most frames, talking to each other. Frames that alternate
  between one-person close-ups are NOT this, however many people appear.

"none" is by far the most common correct answer. Choose anything else only if
you would defend it to an editor. If you are unsure, answer "none".

confidence is 0..1. why is at most 12 words.

WIDE_CONTENT_PROMPT_TEMPLATE = """
You are preparing a landscape video to be re-framed to a vertical 9:16 crop.
The crop keeps a tall centre strip and THROWS AWAY the left and right sides.

List every time range where on-screen content would be cut by that, and for each
one report HOW MUCH OF THE FRAME WIDTH the content spans.

width_fraction is the single most important field. Measure the content's own
horizontal extent, from its left edge to its right edge, as a fraction of the
full frame width:
- a spreadsheet, slide, screen recording or map filling the picture: 0.9 - 1.0
- a chart or diagram beside a speaker: 0.4 - 0.7
- a lower-third or headline strip across the bottom: 0.6 - 0.9
- a logo, channel bug, score counter or subscriber count in a corner: 0.1 - 0.2
- subtitles centred at the bottom: 0.3 - 0.5

Report what you actually see. Do NOT inflate the number to make a range seem
worth reporting, and do NOT leave out corner graphics — report them with their
true small width_fraction. A range reported honestly at 0.15 is useful; the same
range reported at 0.9 makes the video worse.

COUNT a range when the frame shows:
- a screen recording, slide, spreadsheet, chart, graph or map
- headlines, labels, statistics or comparison tables burned into the picture
- a side-by-side or split-screen layout
- any diagram or product shot where the edges carry the meaning

DO NOT count an ordinary talking head, even against a busy background, and do
not count b-roll, landscapes, crowds or action footage with no graphics.

TIME CONTRACT — STRICT:
- ABSOLUTE SECONDS from the start, numbers only, up to 3 decimals.
- 0 <= start < end <= {video_duration}.
